# EncryptionProject
Harpocrates is an encryption software project that provides an extra layer of security to the user's data. The main aim was to apply computational thinking to create a cipher algorithm capable of encrypting and decrypting the provided data with a key. It's inspired from Caesar's Cipher.

Requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Tkinter library

If you don't have Tkinter installed then, to install use:   
For Windows OS:   
  command> pip install tk   
For RedHat OS:   
  command$ sudo pip3 install tk   

In the main menu it provides two services i.e. encryption and decryption. Each service operates further in two different modes i.e. manual and file mode. Upon encryption, a 24 digit unique key is generated and is required for decryption in future. Without the key, the data can't be encrypted. Also, there are 2.49 quadrillion key combinations that make it hard to break by brute-forcing.

Note: 
1. The program is capable only to encrypt alphabets.
2. Be careful if you're copy-pasting in the CLI and avoid copy-pasting any extra spaces or line breaks, else it'll cause unexpected failure.
