# EncryptionProject
The aim of this project is to add an extra layer of security to the users messages. It's inspired from Caesar's Cipher. 

In the main menu it provides two services i.e. encryption and decryption. Each service operates further in two different modes i.e. manual and file mode. Upon encryption, a 24 digit unique key is generated and is required for decryption in future. Without the key, the data can't be encrypted. Also, there are 2.49 quadrillion key combinations that make it hard to break by brute-forcing.

Note: 
1. The program is capable only to encrypt alphabets.
2. Be careful if you're copy-pasting in the CLI and avoid copy-pasting any extra spaces or line breaks, else it'll cause unexpected failure.
